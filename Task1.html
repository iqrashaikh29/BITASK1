          <h2>Pandemic Detection through KNN Algorithm and
            COVID-19 Detection using ML.</h2>
          <p>
            The Proposed System is developed using Python, with the help of web framework Flask. The system is made capable of detecting, evaluating and measuring theseverity of an outbreak using some predefined parameters which are taken in count. The
            systemcomprises of two modules: Epidemic and COVID
            module. The data collected by these modules are sent to
            the ML Algorithm which thereafter evaluate the inputs and predicts the result

          <h2>Drowsiness Detection System using ML</h2>
          <p>
            This proposed system describes a machine learning approach for drowsiness detection. Face detection is employed to 
            locate the regions of the driver's eyes,<br> which are used as the templates for eye tracking in subsequent frames. Finally, 
            the tracked eye's images are used for <br> drowsiness detection in order to generate warning alarms. This proposed approach 
            has three stages: detecting Face, <br>detecting Eyes and detecting drowsiness. Image processing is used to recognize the 
            face of the driver and then its extracts the <br>image of the eyes of the driver for detection of drowsiness. The HOG + 
            Linear SVM algorithm takes as captured frames of image<br> and then the detected face is considered as output. Next, 
            Contourfitting is used for tracking eyes from the detected face. Using EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) the eye state is detected. <br>
            The system uses frames for face and eye-tracking, and the average correct rate for eye location and tracking could 
            achieve 95.0% based on some test videos. Thus, the proposed approach for real-time drivers drowsiness detection is a 
            low-cost and effective solution method
